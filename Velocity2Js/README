In order to fix a problem with nested loops, Velocity2Js was recompiled with
Velocity 1.6.4, and changes were made to the JSRendererFast class to fix the
bug.

In upgrading to Velocity 1.6.4, an unusual bug occurred where some of the 
visit methods in the VelocityVisitor class of the Velocity2Js application
 were being improperly called.

Instead of going to the function where the signature matched:  for example,
if visit(astAddNode, object) was how it was called, instead of going to the
visit(ASTAddNode, Object), it would instead go to the visit(SimpleNode, Object)
method, where ASTAddNode is the grandchild of SimpleNode.  Most of the
methods are correctly called, but not any of the method which inherit
from ASTMathNode which is an abstract class inheriting from SimpleNode
which was added between release 1.5 and 1.6 of Velocity.

To fix this, code has been added to visit(SimpleNode, Object) in the
VelocityVisitor class of Velocity2Js which
correctly calls the proper method.

If changes are made to the code or Velocity is updated, this needs
to be revisited.
