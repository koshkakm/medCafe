Run the xjc process using:

xjc -d src ADJE2369.xsd -b anyTypeMapping2.xjb

to map the CCR XML to Java.  This fixes the Java code (but not the annotations) for the elements that do not have a type specified in the xsd.  These are Signature in the SignatureType element, Value in the AttributeValue element in the ObjectAttribute element in the CodedDescriptionType and NickName in the PersonNameType.

It also fixes a problem with OrderRxHistoryType where it extends a base type that already has an element IDs and adds anoter element of the same name.  



After you are done generating the classes, modify the XmlElement annotation on signature in the SignatureType class by removing the ", type=Object.class"

Do the same for Value in AttributeValue in ObjectAttribute in CodedDescriptionType and NickName in PersonNameType.

Then compile the classes.  This avoids the circular reference problem caused by these fields not havng a specified type and being mapped to Object.
