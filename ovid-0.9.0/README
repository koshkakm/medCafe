This package contains the three main source projects of the Ovid
layer.  For more information regarding Ovid, please refer to
http://medsphere.org/docs/DOC-1395.

Ovid is the OpenVista Interface Domain layer whose purpose is to
enable access to OpenVista data.  It is implemented in java but could
have implementations in other languages with a little work.

In this package, you will find the ovid, fmdomain and fileman
sources.  Each builds independently.  Ovid requires fmdomain and
fileman.  All of these projects have been built with ant, netbeans and
eclipse.

The ovid package is the driver project as it uses the fmdomain and
fileman projects to create repository classes of OpenVista data.  The
repository is not complete, but it is active and we are adding to it
as we find create classes that could be useful to other projects.  We
are hoping to have more classes contributed in the future from project
members.

Please review each project's README file.
