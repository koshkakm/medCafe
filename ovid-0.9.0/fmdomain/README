OVID is an OpenVista Interface Domain layer.  Its purpose is to make it
easier to take advantage of the rich data available in the OpenVista server.

This package, FMDomain, is a collection of classes that are outlined to
represent the data in specific Fileman files.  As new Fileman files are needed
and implemented, they should end up here.
