Building
--------

- install Java v6 and apache ant.
- type: ant
  from the top-level.  You should end up with a dist/ovid.jar.  Copy it
  to the ./contrib/medsphere directory.

Running
-------

Ovid is usually included in other projects.  However, you can run the
get-patients.sh script (or get-patients.bat) to validate that everything
is configured correctly.

Please refer to the following document to prepare OpenVista.
