OVID is an OpenVista Interface Domain layer.  Its purpose is to make it
easier to take advantage of the rich data available in the OpenVista server.

OVID does this by facilitating the calling of OpenVista Remote Procedure Calls
(RPCs).  OVID also supplies RPCs that can invoke the fileman "silent-mode" (e.g.
DBS) calls.  So, if a suitable RPC does not exist, fileman access will always
be available.

OVID currently does not access mumps globals directly.  I doubt it ever would
try.  Our intent is to leverage the existing mumps server APIs already
available in the form of fileman and existing RPCs.  These APIs are rich and
mature and, after an "assimilation" period, easy to navigate and discover.

By allowing access to this data in java, we can then leverage other
technologies outside of OpenVista to complement OpenVista's data.  For example,
an OpenVista drug could be easily cross referenced with an external drug
database to provide third-party drug information.

Collaboration
-------------

Medsphere OVID is part of a larger open source project. Aspects of the design, 
requirements definition, development, and testing are done in the community.
Medsphere.org is the central location for this collaborative development
process.

Medsphere.org provides all participants access to the solution development 
process and a voice in how the system evolves.  You can download open source 
software, start discussions, host projects, build clinical content/best 
practices, ask questions, make suggestions and blog about progress.

 * Collaborate 24 x 7
 * Share in the improvement of healthcare
 * Influence the OpenVista roadmap
 * Get answers to your questions from experts, peers, colleagues and others
