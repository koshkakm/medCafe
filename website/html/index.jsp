            medCafe demonstrates new, more efficient ways for a physician to interact with patient records.
            Using an intuitive interface, a physician can build exactly the patient record he wants to see.
            Built for flexibility, medCafe demonstrates how a physician need no longer be constrained by an EHR system.
            medCafe enables a healthcare worker to view data from multiple sources and EHR systems, all in one interface.

            <h3>medCafe Approach: Advantages for the Physician</h3>
            <p>
            <ul><li>Adapt to clinician's individual needs and patient circumstances. Providing clinicians with the right tools and right resources at the right time</li>
             	<li>Rapidly reacquire what was most important the last time you saw a patient</li>
				<li>Allow users to quickly build, modify, and customize their personal patient interaction record</li>
				<li>Use templates to mirror common patient use cases</li>
				<li>Connect seamlessly to multiple patient record repositories</li>
				<li>Designed for flexibility and adaptability.  Designed to change and evolve with changing needs</li>
				<li><b>Demonstrates a more efficient way for physicians to interact with patient record</b></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>medCafe Approach: Advantages for the Practice</h3>
            <p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Can start small, grow functionality over time focusing on the capability practice cares about</li>
            	<li>Can add new data sources as they become available</li>
            	<li>Can help design new components as new capabilities are envisioned</li>
            	<li>System completely adaptable to changing practice circumstances</li>
            	<li>Framework allows for ease of system evolution</li>
            	<li>Allows for Best of Breed of components: Better components can replace existing ones at any time</li>
            	<li><b>Demonstrates a more effective way to build a system a practice needs</b></li>

            <h3>medCafe Mission</h3>
            <p>
           	medCafe is a research project funded by <a href="http://www.mitre.org" target="blank">The MITRE Corporation</a> to explore the viability of specific system design principles for Electronic Health Record (EHR) access. By building a functioning prototype we were able to determine both the feasibiltiy of the approach and show the results to physicians to determine how well the approach worked.</p>
            <p>Being an <a href="http://mitre.org/about/ffrdcs.html" target="blank">FFRDC</a>, MITRE has released this code under an open source license with the hope that others will explore and expand our solution and approach and build a fully-functioning EHR from it.</p>
