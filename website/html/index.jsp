			<h2>Welcome to our website</h2>
            <p><img src="images/medCafe_logo.png" class="alignleft" alt="logo" />medCafe is a research project funded by <a href="http://www.mitre.org" target="blank">The MITRE Corporation</a> to explore the viability of specific system design principles for Electronic Health Record (EHR) access. By building a functioning prototype we were able to determine both the feasibiltiy of the approach and show the results to physicians to determine how well the approach worked.</p>
            <p>Being an <a href="http://mitre.org/about/ffrdcs.html" target="blank">FFRDC</a>, MITRE has released this code under an open source license with the hope that others will explore and expand our solution and approach and build a fully-functioning EHR from it.</p>
